# 🐧 What is Linux?

Linux is an **open-source operating system (OS)**, similar in purpose to Windows or macOS.

An operating system is the core software that:

1. Manages all hardware resources like CPU, memory, disk, and devices.  
2. Provides a foundation for applications to run.  
3. Is **case-sensitive** — for example, `kkfunda.txt` and `KKFUNDA.txt` are treated as two different files.  
4. Was created in **1991 by Linus Torvalds**.

## ✨ Key Features of Linux

- **Multitasking**: Can run multiple programs at the same time without slowing down or crashing.  
- **Multi-user**: Supports multiple users accessing the system simultaneously without interfering with each other.

## 🆓 Free vs Open Source

### Free:
- Free means you can use the software without cost, but the source code is not available.  
- You **cannot see, modify, or improve** the code.  
- You cannot add your own features to it.

### Open Source:
- Open-source means the source code is freely available to everyone.  
- Anyone can **see, modify, improve, or share** the code.  
- You can add your own features to Linux and use it in your projects.

## 🧱 Basic Linux Architecture

- **Hardware** – Physical parts like CPU, RAM, disk, and input/output devices.  
- **Kernel** – The core of the OS; controls hardware like CPU, memory, and devices.  
- **Shell** – Interface to run commands and talk to the kernel (like bash).  
- **Utilities** – Command-line tools to manage files, monitor the system, control users, and handle networking.  
- **File System** – Organizes data into files and directories (everything is treated as a file).  
- **Applications** – Software like browsers, text editors, and tools that run on top of Linux.

## 🐧 Some Popular Linux Distributions (Distros)

- **Ubuntu** – Best for beginners  
- **CentOS / AlmaLinux / Rocky** – Popular in servers  
- **Debian** – Stable and used in base distros  
- **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** – Enterprise and Commercial Use

## 🔌 Some Tools to Connect to Linux Machines

- **Git Bash** – Popular on Windows for running Linux-like commands including SSH.  
- **PuTTY** – A lightweight SSH client for Windows, widely used for remote access.  
- **MobaXterm** – An advanced terminal for Windows with SSH, X11 forwarding, and many networking tools.  
- **macOS Terminal** – Built-in terminal on Macs, supports SSH natively.

# 📁 Linux Directory Structure

---

## 1. `/` — Root Directory

```bash
/    # This is the top-level directory in Linux. Everything starts from /
````

👉 Lists all top-level directories like `/bin`, `/etc`, `/home`, `/tmp`, etc.

---

## 2. `/root` → Root User’s Home Directory

```bash
/root    # This is the personal directory of the root (admin) user.
```

👉 Goes to the root user’s home and lists hidden files like `.bashrc`, `.ssh`, etc.

---

## 3. `/bin` → Basic User Commands

```bash
/bin     # Contains essential user commands like ls, cp, cat, mv, rm.
```

👉 Lists first 10 commands available in `/bin`.

---

## 4. `/sbin` → System Administration Commands

```bash
/sbin    # Contains system-level commands (only root normally uses).
```

👉 Lists system admin binaries like `shutdown`, `reboot`, `ifconfig`.

---

## 5. `/opt` → Optional (Third-Party) Software

```bash
/opt     # Used for installing third-party or extra software.
```

---

## 6. `/etc` → System Configuration Files

```bash
/etc     # Contains all configuration files for services and applications.
```

---

## 7. `/home` → User Home Directories

```bash
/home    # Each user gets a directory here (e.g., /home/satya, /home/dev).
```

👉 Lists all users’ home directories.

---

## 8. `/tmp` → Temporary Files

```bash
/tmp     # Used for temporary storage. Cleared after reboot.
```

👉 Creates a temporary file in `/tmp`.

```
