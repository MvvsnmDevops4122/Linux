##  Viewing Disk Information

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `lsblk` | Display all block devices (disks and partitions) |
| `fdisk -l` | List all disk partitions and details |
| `df -h` | Show disk space usage in a human-readable format (GB/MB) |
| `du -sh /path` | Display the total size of a specific directory |

---

##  Formatting a Partition

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1` | Format a partition with the **ext4** filesystem |
| `mkfs.xfs /dev/sdX1` | Format a partition with the **XFS** filesystem |

> ⚠️ **Note:** Replace `/dev/sdX1` with your actual partition name (e.g., `/dev/sdb1`).

##  Mounting and Unmounting Partitions

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt` | Mount a partition to a directory (mount point) |
| `umount /mnt` | Unmount a partition from its mount point |

##  Additional Tips

- To view mounted file systems:
  ```bash
  mount | column -t
````

* To check disk usage of all mounted filesystems:

  ```bash
  df -Th
  ```
* To find large files/directories:

  ```bash
  du -ah / | sort -rh | head -n 10
  ```

---

✅ **Quick Example**

```bash
# 1. List all disks
lsblk

# 2. Format the new partition as ext4
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1

# 3. Create a mount directory
sudo mkdir /mnt/data

# 4. Mount the partition
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data

# 5. Verify mount
df -h

# 6. Unmount when done
sudo umount /mnt/data
```

📘 **Summary**

* `lsblk`, `fdisk` → View disk details
* `df`, `du` → Check usage
* `mkfs.*` → Format partitions
* `mount`, `umount` → Manage mounts
